# KarmenLoop Patch Risk Review

Patch Risk Review gives you a starting point for reviewing a Git diff. It summarizes the changed files and highlights areas such as authentication, storage, dependencies, and tests.

The code is [MIT licensed](LICENSE). The local helper needs Python 3.9 or later, with no subscription or provider API key.

## Introduction

Use the exact base and head revisions for the change. The helper reads diff headers and hunk ranges to count changes and retain file locations. Its suggestions help you decide where to look; they are not findings that a bug or security problem exists.

The package includes an agent skill, a local Python helper, example data, and tests. The skill guides the conversation; the helper processes the supplied data.

## Capabilities

- Count additions and removals per changed path.
- Mark authentication, persistence, dependency, and test surfaces.
- Preserve source locations for follow-up inspection.

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.9+. Git is needed only for cloning; downloading the release archive also works. On Windows, replace python3 with py -3 if that is your installed launcher.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KarmenLoop/skill-patch-risk-review.git
cd skill-patch-risk-review
python3 scripts/run.py --input examples/input.json
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Compare the result with [examples/expected.json](examples/expected.json). For your own data, follow the [input format](docs/INPUT.md). Relative file paths are resolved from the directory where you run the command.

To save a result without overwriting an existing file:

```sh
python3 scripts/run.py --input examples/input.json --output result.json
```

### Install the agent skill

Install it for the agent host you use:

```sh
python3 install.py --host codex
# Alternatives: --host deepseek, --host grok, or --host agents
```

The installer copies the skill into your host's skill directory. It stops if that directory already exists. To choose another location, pass `--destination` with a new directory. Host settings, credentials, permissions, and other skills are left alone.

In Codex, invoke $karmen-patch-risk-review. In Grok Build, invoke /karmen-patch-risk-review. In another compatible host, select the installed skill by name. Example request:

> Where should I look first when reviewing this patch?

Refresh your host's skill discovery if needed. See [compatibility and its verification limits](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## How it works

Diff headers identify files; hunk markers constrain line counting. Path categories guide targeted review without presenting heuristics as security findings.

The result is JSON, so you can save it or pass it to another tool. Exit code `0` means the helper finished, even when its findings need attention. Exit code `2` means the input or a file operation failed. The helper does not run shell commands from the input or overwrite an existing output file.

## Documentation

- [Agent instructions](SKILL.md): selection, workflow, and completion criteria.
- [Input and output](docs/INPUT.md): fields and complete example.
- [Compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md): installation targets and host limits.
- [Validation](docs/VALIDATION.md): observed local results and acceptance scenarios.
- [Sources](docs/SOURCES.md): public research references and design decisions.
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md): release history.

## Limitations

The helper does not understand syntax or prove vulnerabilities. Binary files are inventoried only when a diff header is present. It does not fetch, apply, or execute a patch.

Examples are synthetic. Local tests establish the covered helper behavior; they do not establish an authenticated provider integration or the quality of every future model response. Tools and account access remain those of the host.

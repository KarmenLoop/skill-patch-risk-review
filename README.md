## Introduction

Use the exact base/head diff and the repository's current requirements. A text heuristic is a review starting point, not a defect finding. Diff headers identify files; hunk markers constrain line counting. Path categories guide targeted review without presenting heuristics as security findings.

This repository ships one independently installable agent skill, an original deterministic helper, example input, and executable tests. A capable agent handles interpretation and tool selection; the helper performs the repeatable work described below.

## Capabilities

- Count additions and removals per changed path.
- Mark authentication, persistence, dependency, and test surfaces.
- Preserve source locations for follow-up inspection.

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.9+. Git is needed only for cloning; downloading the release archive also works. On Windows, replace python3 with py -3 if that is your installed launcher.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KarmenLoop/skill-patch-risk-review.git
cd skill-patch-risk-review
python3 scripts/run.py --input examples/input.json
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The helper returns a structured result. Compare it with [examples/expected.json](examples/expected.json). Read the [field contract](docs/INPUT.md) before supplying your own data. Any documented relative file paths resolve from the process working directory.

To save a result without overwriting an existing file:

```sh
python3 scripts/run.py --input examples/input.json --output result.json
```

### Install the agent skill

Choose one host:

```sh
python3 install.py --host codex
# Alternatives: --host deepseek, --host grok, or --host agents
```

The installer copies this skill into the selected user's skill directory and refuses an existing destination. It does not change host settings, permissions, credentials, or other skills. Use --destination with an exact new directory for a custom installation.

In Codex, invoke $karmen-patch-risk-review. In Grok Build, invoke /karmen-patch-risk-review. In another compatible host, select the installed skill by name. Example request:

> Review this patch for behavior risks and needed tests.

Refresh your host's skill discovery if needed. See [compatibility and its verification limits](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## How it works

Diff headers identify files; hunk markers constrain line counting. Path categories guide targeted review without presenting heuristics as security findings.

JSON results can be inspected, archived, or passed to another tool. The helper never interprets input as a shell command. Exit code 0 means processing completed; findings may still require action. Exit code 2 means invalid input or a filesystem error. Existing output files are preserved.

## Documentation

- [Agent instructions](SKILL.md): selection, workflow, and completion criteria.
- [Input and output](docs/INPUT.md): fields and complete example.
- [Compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md): installation targets and host limits.
- [Validation](docs/VALIDATION.md): observed local results and acceptance scenarios.
- [Sources](docs/SOURCES.md): public research references and design decisions.
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md): release history.

## Limitations

The helper does not understand syntax or prove vulnerabilities. Binary files are inventoried only when a diff header is present. It does not fetch, apply, or execute a patch.

Examples are synthetic. Local tests establish the covered helper behavior; they do not establish an authenticated provider integration or the quality of every future model response. Tools and account access remain those of the host.
